    title: "Nobody Told Us What To Do – 05/23/25",
    content: "Nobody told us what to do. Every sound, every melody, every rhythm in our songs came entirely from us. Pure, unbridled expression of the ineffable. We have important meanings to convey… messages without words. Things that cant be read, but can be heard. We don’t sit down and think “let me write a song”. It’s the other way around – the song tells us “sit down and write this now”. We do not care about our identities. Our music is not us, but we are our music. It goes beyond our daily lives and the things that we do therein. Everything we write is an unadulterated expression of the ineffable. A message that people need to hear. A message that people will hear. It has never been about us. This goes beyond. In a future date, we will look back at this time and think “how did we do that?”, “how did those thoughts come to us?” . Every stone was placed by us. When we stand atop our tower and look down upon what we built, we will marvel in disbelief.\nThe Voice of the Ineffable has found a worthy host within our corporeal bodies. We must allow it to speak while it resides in us."

    title: "Our Journey As Artists – 10/16/24",
    content: "Our journey as artists is about pushing boundaries and transmuting the ineffable into something tangible through music. We use our sound as a conduit for powerful, often overlooked societal messages, turning them into digestible, emotional experiences for our listeners. We believe music has the power to open minds and bring awareness. People have these feelings that are hidden deep within them, because they cant name them. Our music brings out those latent feelings - that’s our mission.\nOur evolution has been defined by a relentless pursuit of the ineffable— manifesting in ripping guitar solos, heavy riffage, and driving drums,  balanced with vocals that shift between smooth resonance and gritty edge. We don’t shy away from contrasting emotions. We bring energy, hope, and fulfillment while diving into the depths of despair and desperation. We want our listeners to feel everything. We see our music as a mirror, reflecting the chaos and beauty of life, and as a reminder that there’s always something worth fighting for."

    title: "Thoughts on Crafting Aura as a Musician – 05/22/25",
    content: "The modern push is toward visibility, relatability, approachability. You see it in the endless stream of TikToks: musicians in their bedrooms, POV skits, breakup soundtracks and musicians begging viewers to check out their music. It’s marketed as intimacy and relatability but often it comes at the cost of power and aura.\nArtists build worlds, while content creators seek views. While both can use the same tools, the effect could not be more different.\nWhat truly moves people is not just the aura that surrounds something. It’s the distance. The unknowable. The feeling that you are entering someone else’s world… not watching them try to enter yours.\nThe goal is for the listener to submit to the art (not the musician). Then we know we have served our purpose. Submission requires distance. Not coldness, but reverence. It requires the artist to hold back just enough, to maintain a veil so that the audience has something to step through. Something sacred. Something they don’t feel entitled to.\nWhen an artist allows too much of themselves to be seen in casual, algorithm driven snippets, the myth dissolves. They become personalities, not portals. Without realizing it, the audience begins to engage with the person rather than the music. They like you, but they don’t submit to the art.\nThere is more power in what is observed than what is self-revealed. The band being interviewed by someone else. The footage caught from across the room. The glimpse into the creative process that feels stumbled upon, not performed. That’s how we build mystique. That’s how we protect the world our music is creating\nWe don’t want to be just seen. We want to be encountered. It’s not about exposure, it’s about presence."

    title: "Heathen (song) – 04/19/25",
    content: "Beauty that is rotting underneath. The Heathen blurs the lines between liberation and surrender.\nHeathen is a cautionary tale about manipulative forces. It is a narrative - a short story set to music. The lyrics are a dramatic portrayal of seduction, manipulation, transformation, and identity. Performing this piece doesn’t mean you are endorsing every aspect of it in real life. In fact, it is quite clearly a visceral cautionary tale against the heathen (I.e. “you’re not who you used to be, do you remember that time?”). The lyrics explore some of humanity’s oldest themes: light vs dark, self vs surrender, innocence vs corruption."

    title: "On My Bestfriend (song) – 03/20/25",
    content: "Complicated thoughts and introspections are nothing more than the summations of individual miseries.\nWhen isolated Moments of Sorrow are amalgamated, the result is an emotional landscape that is wholly distinct from its constituents.\nI wrote this to explain the guitar arrangement in My Best Friend. Each individual part is miserable, but when they are intertwined, the emotion changes. It expands, becoming a spacey and introspective feeling. The dread which was previously ever-present, now lies latent within the harmonies.\nIt reminds me of the way we think about outer space. We often look up at the sky and think (1)  “who is out there?” and (2) “what else is out there?”. These questions are nothing more than a self-deception, protecting us from the harsh reality that we ought not to confront head on. We must ask these questions, rather than face the eviscerating truth. Within these questions the concealed inverse is hidden, which reveals the harrowing truth:\nI am alone.\nThis is it."

    title: "The Blue Octavo Live Monologue – 05/15/25",
    content: "Opening Monologue\nWelcome to the Blue Octavo\nWe are the screams beneath your smile\nWe are the ache in your ribs that has no name\nWe are the child that you once were\nWe are the hope that you left behind\nWe are the space within the silence\nWe are what is left after language fails\nWe are… the ineffable.\nWe are.. the blue octavo\n(Durarion: 0:35)\n(Drummer counts off the beat) (Play “Get this Back”)\n(Before Heathen. We repeat the following mantra, accompanied by kick drum and guitar):\nLet Me In (x20)\n(Duration: 1:00)\n(Heathen Plays)\nWe write songs to speak truths.\nWithin our notes lies a language that we can’t speak but we can feel\nA rhythm that can’t explain, but can heal\nMelodies that can’t be seen but are just as real.\nWe do not exist, except within these hymns. And tonight….\nif you hear us,\nif you feel us,\nthen we are alive.\nNot as people.\nBut as echoes.\nAs the Blue Octavo\n(0:39 seconds)\n(Becoming Me Plays)\nNot every song feels good.\nSome of them pull things out of us that we thought we buried long ago\nSome don’t heal.\nRather, they bleed\nBut we can’t heal a wound before we bleed\nWe can’t plan these things. They show up at our door uninvited. They pour through us, whether we are ready or not\nIf something hurts tonight, that’s ok. That means you’re still alive. That means you still have something to feel.\nLet it hurt. Let it burn. And then let it burn down so that you can see the light again. We can’t heal our wounds before we bleed.\nThis song is called Loving You. It’s about giving your whole self to someone, only to have them stab you in the back\n(Loving You plays)\nHow are we feeling tonight? We are The Blue octavo, etc\nIn an upside down world, those with wings will drown, and those with chains will fly (repeat 5 times)\nThose who dwell beneath strive to clip the wings of those who fly\n(Cardboard Kings plays)"
